## Overview
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to segment images based on RGB color values. Each pixel is classified into one of three categories: red, green, or blue, based on its dominant color component.

## Usage
```bash
python classification.py
```
## Result
### K-Nearest Neighbors
